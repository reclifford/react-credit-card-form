# react-credit-card-form
A simple credit card built in React to practice my react skills with.

Card information populates on the displayed credit card to emulate how information will look on a card.
Card will flip to show back of card and CVV when credit card is hovered or the CVV input is inFocus.

Simplified card validations include:<br />
* Confirming cardholder name is at least 3 characters long.<br />
* Confirming cardholder name has at least one space (firstname and lastname)<br />
* Card number length is 16 characters.<br />
* Card expiration month is selected.<br />
* Card expiration year is selected.<br />
* CVV length is 3 characters.<br />

When submitted, an alert will appear indicating if the card information is accepted or not accepted.
